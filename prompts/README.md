## Pipeline Prompts
We include prompts for creating the initial annotations for Celadon's training dataset, as well as prompts for the content warning 
and synthetic rewriting steps of the pipeline. The prompts were written in English, and then passed through Google translate in 
order to obtain versions in other languages. Since these were initially created for internal use, we do not have versions for
all languages used in the public version of Celadon. We strongly suggest that, should you use this pipeline on other languages,
to translate the prompt into the language of the sample, such that your LLM annotator has the highest liklihood of responding
in that language.
